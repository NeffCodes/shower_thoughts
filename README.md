This site allows you to write and share publicly your "shower thoughts" with other users, or keep a private collection for yourself.

"Shower thought" is a loose term that applies to the types of thoughts you might have while carrying out a routine task like showering, driving, or daydreaming. At their best, shower thoughts are universally relatable and find the amusing/interesting within the mundane.
